## 2.0.0

1. **Vertical Scroll Direction**: Added full support for vertical scrolling layouts (`Axis.vertical`) with vertical-only 3D skew rotation along the X-axis and dynamic vertical spacing controls.
2. **Synchronized Overlay Translation**: Overlays now translate smoothly vertically from down to up (`30.0 * distance`) as they fade in, with automated alignment adjustments to eliminate cross-axis diagonal drift during card scaling transitions.
3. **Compulsory scrollDirection Parameter**: Marked the `scrollDirection` constructor parameter as `required` in `CoverflowCarousel.builder` to improve layout explicitness (breaking API change).
4. **Scroll Progress Streams & Notifiers**: Exposed broadcast streams (`pageStream` and `rawPageStream`) and value notifiers (`pageListenable` and `rawPageListenable`) on `CoverflowCarouselController` to listen to fractional and raw scroll progress.
5. **Robust Test Suite**: Refactored the widget test suite to prevent event loop hangs using synchronous notifiers, and verified vertical layout coordinates, overlay translation, and key preservation.

## 1.3.0

1. **Optimized Card Blur**: Replaced expensive `BackdropFilter` layout stacking with direct, offscreen hardware-accelerated `ImageFiltered` composition, eliminating GPU framebuffer readbacks and frame drops.
2. **Customizable Height Constraints**: Added `height` configuration to the carousel with developer safety assertions preventing layout overflows.
3. **Scroll Wheel Toggle**: Exposed `enableScrollWheel` to enable or disable mouse scroll wheel navigation to prevent vertical web scroll trapping.
4. **UX-Polished Autoplay Support**: Integrated `autoplay`, `autoplayInterval`, and `autoplayPauseOnHover` background loops with scroll-linked pause/resume controls (pauses on pointer drag and mouse hover).
5. **Skew-Aware 3D Elevation Shadows**: Added unified shadow parameters (`enableShadow`, `shadowColor`, `elevation`, and `cardBorderRadius`) drawing layered, soft double shadows. Background cards cast static skew-aligned shadows, and the centered card dynamically shifts its shadow offset simulating a shifting light source.
6. **Center Overlay Tilt Integration & Size Constraints**: Nested overlay stack elements inside the 3D hover region to tilt badges and play buttons in synchronization with the card surface, while explicitly setting `fit: StackFit.expand` on stack layers to preserve correct card dimensions.
7. **Buttery-Smooth Hover Interpolation**: Transitioned hover tilt updates to a frame-rate independent `Ticker`-based smooth lerp at 15% per frame with auto-sleeping when idle.
8. **Customizable Carousel Mode**: Added the `mode` parameter supporting `CoverflowMode.coverflow` (3D stacked) and `CoverflowMode.classic` (flat edge-to-edge carousel slider) presets with dynamic parameter resolutions (visible items, skew, spacing, and viewport fraction).

## 1.2.1

1. **Smooth Scroll**: The scroll is now smoother.
2. **New Demos**: Added new demos.

## 1.2.0

1. **Center Card Overlay**: Added `centerOverlayBuilder` to `CoverflowCarousel.builder` allowing custom overlay widgets (such as play buttons, badges, or tags) to be stacked on the active centered card.
2. **Smooth Fade Transition**: The center overlay automatically fades in and out smoothly using a scroll-linked opacity calculation based on the card's distance from the center.
3. **Flexible Positioning**: Developers can use standard Flutter alignment and layout widgets (`Align`, `Positioned`, `Center`) inside the overlay builder to place the widget anywhere on the card.
4. **Interactive Overlays**: Overlay widgets on the active centered card are fully interactive and support pointer events (like button taps/onPressed), while off-center cards redirect taps to focus the card.
5. **3D Hover/Tilt Effect**: Added support for interactive 3D perspective tilting of the active centered card as the mouse pointer hovers over it. Includes configuration properties `enableHoverTilt` and `maxHoverTiltAngle`.
6. **Mouse Scroll Wheel Navigation**: Added support for mouse scroll wheel and trackpad scroll navigation to scroll to the next and previous cards.
7. **Throttled Scroll Events**: Throttled consecutive scroll signals relative to the animation duration to prevent rapid card skipping and ensure smooth transitions.
8. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Confined hover calculations and rebuilds locally to the centered card, preventing parent repaints.
   - Wrapped tilted card children in a `RepaintBoundary` to leverage GPU matrix transformations and prevent expensive rasterization repaints.
   - Fixed the resetting tilt animation to utilize linear interpolation from cached start offsets, preventing compounding timer decay.
9. **Robust Testing**: Expanded package and example tests to cover mouse wheel navigation, scroll throttling, and 3D hover gestures.

## 1.1.2

1. Fixed swiping on mobile applications.

## 1.1.1

1. **Example Application**: Added a complete, interactive, and beautifully styled example application under `example/` demonstrating infinite scroll, entry animations, blur obscuring, and programmatic controllers.

## 1.1.0

1. **Infinite Scroll**: Added `isInfinite` support for seamless circular scrolling and shortest-path programmatic animations.
2. **Entry Animations**: Added `entryAnimation` parameter supporting staggered fades, zooms, spacing expansions, slides, and front-stacking (`fadeIn`, `scaleUp`, `spacingExpand`, `staggeredSlide`, `fadeScale`, and `stack`).
3. **Card Interactivity**: Side-cards now support click-to-focus, and centered cards are fully interactive (clicks pass to inner buttons without interference).
4. **Web & Desktop Dragging**: Enabled mouse click-and-drag swiping on Web and Desktop.
5. **Scrollbar Suppression**: Disabled the native scrollbar from drawing behind cards.
6. **Custom Viewport Fraction**: Added `viewportFraction` property supporting dynamic hot updates.
7. **Optimized BackdropFilter**: Blur filters are only drawn when active, improving GPU rendering.
8. **Testing**: Built a full suite of 10 widget tests verifying layouts, gestures, entry transitions, and controllers.
9. **Code Documentation**: Added 100% pub.dev public API coverage with detailed Dart doc comments (`///`) on all classes, properties, constructors, methods, and enums.
10. **Architecture & Mathematics Reference**: Added `package_documentation.md` containing detailed 3D transform projection matrices, spacing equations, gesture layers, and timeline stagger formulas.
11. **Lint Fixes**: Resolved unnecessary library name lint warnings in export declarations.
